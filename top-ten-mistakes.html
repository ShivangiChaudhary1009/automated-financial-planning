<h2>Top 10 Retirement Mistakes </h2>



<br>

<p>  
  <strong>1. Not taking advantage of retirement accounts with tax benefits.</strong> Many people aren&rsquo;t even aware of retirement accounts that save you on paying taxes. Explore IRA&rsquo;s, 401K&rsquo;s, and other retirement accounts to learn about the advantages that each type of account offers for your situation. It only takes a little bit of time but can save you money on your income taxes or taxes on your dividends and capital gains.<br><br>  
  <strong>2. Failing to stick to the retirement plan.</strong> When times get tough or when the stop market gets really volatile, investors can cave into the fear that they experience and cash out. Sadly, this usually happens near a market bottom. Understandably, we like stability when it comes to our investments and over the short term (5 years) the stock market may not get us that stability. The one who can handle the ups and downs of the market and even take advantage of market drops will over time be greatly rewarded.<br><br>  
  <strong>3. Waiting too long to get started.</strong> In planning for retirement, time is your great friend. The sooner you get started, or the earlier you get started the better. The more money you have earlier on, the more money gets compounded over time. Experiment with our retirement calculator to prove this to yourself.<br>

  <strong>4. Investing badly.</strong> There are several mistakes that can be made here. One mistake would be to not take enough risk for the time horizon that you are investing for. In planning for a retirement that is some years away, a majority of investments should be in a broad-based index fund of stocks. The second mistake you could make would be to invest in individual stocks or vehicles that perform badly. You could greatly outperform the market&rsquo;s performance by picking your own stocks, but this is unlikely for most people. Don&rsquo;t get lured into a mutual fund just because of a fund manager&rsquo;s recent performance or an &ldquo;alternative investment&rdquo; that turns out not to be an investment at all.<br><br>  
  <strong>5. Failing to account to health costs not covered by insurance.</strong> In planning for your retirement, be sure to account for your health care costs that will not be covered by insurance or Medicare. Remember, Medicare does not pay for long-term care. Healthcare costs incurred per individual could be $150,000 or higher for many people.<br><br>  
  <strong>6. Taking social security too early.</strong> Depending on how long you are expected to live, this may or may not be a mistake but for the vast majority that has reached retirement age it pays a lot to wait to start taking that social security payment. <br><br> 
  <strong>7. Quitting your job before you should.</strong> Granted, most people are not super excited about going to work every day, but adding a few years on after the age of 65, can really give your retirement a boost.<br><br>  
  <strong>8. Ignoring major expenses.</strong> Major expenses need to be included in your retirement plan, don&rsquo;t leave these out. If you are planning on getting a vacation home or contributing to a child&rsquo;s college expenses, these expenses need to be factored into your plan.<br><br>  
  <strong>9. Falling for scams.</strong> This seems to happen to some people periodically over time. If it sounds too good to be true or the plan is coming from a firm that you&rsquo;ve never heard of, be very cautious. Scam artists routinely target older people.<br><br>  
  <strong>10. Paying too much in management fees.</strong> Be mindful of the fees that you are paying mutual fund managers and your money managers. If you aren&rsquo;t getting value for those dollars, those fees are reducing your performance greatly.<br><br>  </p>
