<h2>Making Sure Your Nest Egg Lasts as Long as You Do</h2>

<p>Estimating how much money you will need in retirement is something that cannot be calculated with absolute certainty.  In general, people are living longer than they have in the past and this trend is likely to continue into the future.  As medical advances have continued, the average lifespan continues to increase and this increase in average lifespan needs to be factored into your retirement plans.  If you are married, there is strong likelihood that one of you will be living at the age of 90.  A retirement that lasts 25-30 years will become more common.  <br><br>

So, how much do you need or how big does that nest egg need to be?  You may have some fund sources available to you that are working for you right now.  One is social security from the government and another could be a pension benefit from your workplace.  Most younger workers do not receive pension benefits it should be noted.  There are a few factors that will ensure that your nest egg lasts as long as you do.  <br>

<strong>1.  Have a substantial amount of money saved for retirement.</strong>  Ok, this one is totally easier said than done.  Many people don&rsquo;t save and a lot of people can&rsquo;t earn enough money to substantially contribute to their retirement.  If you are not able to balance what&rsquo;s coming and going out during the month, take a step back and work on that part first.  We have an excellent tool on our site that can get you started figuring out what&rsquo;s coming in and out and where you can make adjustments to break even.  The vicious cycle of poverty hits many and as cost continue to rise while wages don&rsquo;t keep up many people struggle.  If you are able to save a good portion of what you earn, consider yourself fortunate and move to the next step.  <br><br> 

<strong>2.  The funds need to be invested properly.  </strong>  This leg of the investment stool definitely need to be strong as well.  Over the course of your working life, you need to take an appropriate amount of risk in order to meet you retirement objectives.  Now, I&rsquo;m not talking about putting your money into some new company that&rsquo;s going to take over the world and betting on that.  What I am talking about is putting your money in an index fund of stocks that gives you diversification across a number of companies and at the same time gives you exposure to the stock market, which over time has been a strong vehicle to get people to their financial goals.  <br><br>     

<strong>3.  Withdraw an appropriate amount for expenses during retirement.  </strong>  Check out our retirement calculator and put in your numbers.  It&rsquo;s an excellent way to get an understanding of how your contributions will get you to where you need to be and if there are adjustments that you need to make.  If you take care of these issues, you are well on your way to a financially sound retirement.  Good for you!<br><br>
