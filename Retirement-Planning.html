<h2>Getting Started on your Retirement Plan</h2>

<p><img id="woman" src="images/woman.jpg" alt="womanimage"> Oh, the dreaded task of retirement planning.  There are a number of tools out there that you can use to get a handle on how you want your retirement to look and getting a handle on these numbers as soon as you can greatly help you be on your way to your goals.  Consider taking a look at the retirement calculator we have on our site and see if the numbers that you are working with get you to where you need to be.  With the right plan, retirement does not have to a mystery that you find out about when you get there, but can actually be something you look forward to with a pretty good understanding of what it will look like.  Here are some factors to consider in creating your retirement plan.<br><br>  

<strong>1.  How do I really plan to live in retirement?</strong>  Are you going to be living at your current standard of living(like you live now) or are you looking to do more in retirement that you did when you were working perhaps because you now have the time?  If you are going to be doing more, then that certainly needs to be factored into the equation.  Remember, there may be a limit to how much you can do if your health does not allow you to travel and get around as much as you would like, which leads to the next item.<br><br> 

<strong>2.  Have you planned for healthcare costs that you could have in retirement?</strong>  Experts suggest that healthcare expenses can cost an additional $250,000 in addition to what is covered by Medicare.  Is this something that you have thought about and consideer that there are situations where this number could be a lot higher?<br>

    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
         style="display:block"
         data-ad-client="ca-pub-9837301855201248"
         data-ad-slot="3378156211"
         data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
    <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    </script>
  </div>

<br>     
<strong>3.  Do you plan on giving money to any heirs?</strong>  If so, you will need to take this amount out of the equation as money you will not be withdrawing out and adjust for that.<br><br>  
<img id="beach" src="images/beach.jpg" alt="womanimage"> <strong>4.  How much money do I expect to get from Social Security or any applicable pensions?</strong>  Whether or not you have a pension can play a big part in determining how much retirement savings you will need.  Most newer employees are not receiving a pension as companies have cut this benefit and put the responsibility for retirement on the employee.</p> <br><br> 

<p><strong>5.  Are you a disciplined investor and how well do you stick to your plans? </strong> Now, no matter how well you are doing on that diet that starts and stops periodically over the years, financial planning is a bit different.  Some people are able to stick to their financial plans year after year until they hit their retirement years.  Others need the helpful hand of a coach or advisor to help them meet their contribution goals.  Find out which camp you fall into and decide if getting an advisor is right for you.  Of course, this kind of help does not come for free but for many, these advisor fees are money well spent at least in the first few years when you are learning about your own risk tolerance and getting better at making disciplined investments.  Once your plan is created, Stick to your plan! This will be a major factor in getting you to where you need to be around retirement time.</p>
