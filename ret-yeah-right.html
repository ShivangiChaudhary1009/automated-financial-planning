<h2>Retirement, Yeah Right! &ndash; (How to Save for Retirement When You Have Issues)</h2>



<p>Retirement, Yeah Right! As I was talking to an acquaintance of mine about retirement and maybe thinking about it, he jumped right in and said, &ldquo;Retirement, yeah right!&rdquo; Given the circumstances that he had in his life, I pretty much agreed with him. The reason why he would not be able to retire was because of health issues that he had and health issues that his family members had. So, what can a person do who is facing circumstances that don&rsquo;t allow them to really save anything for the future? I am going to introduce you to a concept that may not always be popular, but I think it would help anyone in this type of situation. The tip is to do the best that you can with what you have. Yes, that&rsquo;s it in a nutshell. If you do the best that you can with what you have, you may find that you are actually able to do better than you thought. You may find that you are able to save more than you thought and you may feel better about yourself in the process. Amazing things can happen in your budget when you go ahead and take the first step to perhaps reduce your debt, or when you really try to examine your expenses that you make on a monthly basis. So, even if there looks like there&rsquo;s no hope at all for you, don&rsquo;t blindly just accept that you are going to be struggling financially for the rest of your life and put effort into the budgeting process. I am sure that you will benefit in one way or another from it.  There are many people that cannot save anything substantially because of the situation that they are in. Take comfort, knowing that there are many people that are in your situation, you are definitely not alone and you are not a horrible person because you are broke. (Luke 6:20-21) And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: &ldquo;Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. &ldquo;Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied. Even Jesus&rsquo; disciples are poor and their status isn&rsquo;t any lower because of that and they are the closest people to Jesus. I myself have been poor in the past. So, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up too much over your lack of finances.  While you may have made some bad decisions to get yourself into this situation, recognize your faults and build off of them. Is there a particular fault or trait that you have that have put you into a bad financial situation? This is an important question, so don&rsquo;t take it lightly. What can you do about this issue, to maybe not immediately fix it, but make it better? One main reason people never get to retirement is because they simply spend too much. At least in the beginning, every expense needs to be scrutinized to see whether it was appropriate or not for your situation. That process may sound painful but will be well worth the time and effort. Another common issue that people have is they don&rsquo;t make enough money to save anything after their bills are paid. </p><br><br>
<p>Are there skills that you can acquire that would help you earn more? There may be or there may not be, but before you come to a conclusion, really investigate and look at your life to see if there are changes that can be made.  If you lack needed skills to earn more, get additional education to help yourself out. An investment in yourself is often the best investment you can make. Let friends know that you are interested in improving your skills and they may have good advice for you since they know you. You can take many different courses online that are very inexpensive or free. Through your library, there are a number of classes that help people in your situation become more skilled in the labor market as well. If you aren&rsquo;t able to do any of these, you can go on the internet and learn a skill through YouTube or other sites. With the available technology, no one has an excuse for not being able to learn more, there are just too many options available for people.  If you have health issues that prevent you from working to your full potential, you may have a legitimate reason for not saving for the future. It&rsquo;s understandable that success for you means just being able to make it and enjoying each day for what it is. Be sure that your eating habits are not contributing to your health conditions and look to exercise as a way to relax and keep your body in the best shape that it can be in. Do you eat badly? This not only affects your health (which is a totally different subject) but it affects how productive you are at work over the long haul. Often as a person&rsquo;s health gets better, their desire to be more productive goes up as well and they want to learn more too. It&rsquo;s all connected! </p><br><br>

<p>The harsh conclusion is that not everyone gets to retire. From earlier, I can&rsquo;t see a way that my acquaintance will be able to retire. That old adage is true, &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo; Due to circumstances or our own choices, many people will just never be able to retire. Some people will find that they are not able to retire, but what they are able to do is work fewer hours, than they used too. Whatever situation you find yourself in, remember to work hard to improve your situation and at the same time be content with whatever situation you find yourself in financially. This may sound like a contradiction at first but it is really not. Do the best that you can and once you&rsquo;ve done your best, be content with what&rsquo;s been done. As mentioned, do the best you can with what you have. You may be surprised by what your best efforts can bring about.
